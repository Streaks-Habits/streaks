**The nexts priorities includes:**

- Set up notifications to remind you to do your streaks (through messaging services, starting with Matrix)
- Create schedules with a goal of streaks per week (e.g. go to the gym 4 times a week)
- Add an option on the calendars that blocks the action of marking a successful streak from the interface so that it can only be validated from the runners (stop cheating ;) )
- Create a project README
- Create documentation for instance administrators

**Non-priority work includes:**

- Make CLI tools (user_scripts) available from the web interface (both for admins and users)
